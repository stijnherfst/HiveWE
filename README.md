# HiveWE
A Warcraft III world editor. HiveWE focusses on speed and ease of use, especially for large maps where the regular World Editor is often too slow and clunky.  [Thread on Hive](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/introducing-hivewe.303183/)

## Download

See the [releases page](https://github.com/stijnherfst/HiveWE/releases) for binary downloads.

## Build Instructions

For if you want to build HiveWE yourself from source. If you run into any problems then don't be afraid to contact me.

1. Download [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Easiest if you place it in the root of the C drive: "C:/vcpkg"

2. Run bootstrap-vcpkg.bat (or bootstrap-vcpkg.sh for Linux)
3.  
	3.1 Add vcpkg.exe to the Windows environment variable (PATH)  
Or  
	3.2 Open CMD and navigate to the folder containing vcpkg.exe  
4. Run the following commands to install dependencies 

[//]: # (Hello)

	vcpkg install glm:x64-windows  
	vcpkg install soil2:x64-windows
	vcpkg install stormlib:x64-windows
	vcpkg install casclib:x64-windows
	vcpkg install libjpeg-turbo:x64-windows
	vcpkg install qt-advanced-docking-system:x64-windows
	vcpkg install qscintilla:x64-windows
	vcpkg install bullet3:x64-windows




This might take a while depending on your computer (\~20 minutes)  

Now if you placed vcpkg in the root then you are ready to compile HiveWE.  
You can either:  
- Generate the project files for your IDE using CMake  
or  
- Open Visual Studio as an Administrator and using the open folder button to open the HiveWE folder. (Administrator needed for creating a symbolic link on Windows)  

[//]: # (Hello)

**Done**

If you didn't place vcpkg in C:/ then you will need to open CMakeLists.txt and CMakeSettings.json and change the paths containing C:/vcpkg to point to where your vcpkg is located.  
**Done**

If you run into any issues then feel free to contact me.
