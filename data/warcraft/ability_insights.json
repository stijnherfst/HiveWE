(assuming you set Accumulation Value to 1, otherwise it's not smooth sailing)\n      * This means that Pillage DOES NOT stack, and that you should not put multiple units with Pillage to attack a single building, instead try to spread them out to attack other buildings to maximize resources gained.\n   * This ability doesn’t seem to work on buildings (or units) with exactly or more than 10,000 HP for some reason.(needs more testing) EDIT: It actually works, it’s just that the resource calculation is so small that the resources gained often ends up getting rounded down.\n   * Pillage does not gain resources from buildings under construction, or have not yet finished building.\n      * When a building is upgrading itself (eg: Town Halls), it uses the gold and lumber cost of the building of the base Town Hall, as the upgrade has not yet finished. If Town Hall upgrades have finished, it uses the gold and lumber cost of that instead.\n   * Works with ranged units, with the resource gained upon projectile impact provided that it doesn’t miss.\n      * Similarly, resources are gained after successful projectile impact, and after all damage reductions and amplifications have been calculated.\n      * Attack modifier abilities such as Searing Arrows or even Critical Strike do not count in resource calculations.\n      * Siege units that deal splash damage do not gain resources when using the Attack Ground command to deal damage. It must be a direct attack on said structure.\n      * Ranged units that deal splash damage do not gain resources on the units hit by the splash damage, only the primary target grants resources.\n      * Same thing applies for Missile (Bounce) and Artillery (Line) attack type units, as well as units with Cleaving Attack ability, only the primary target gains resources.\n   * Adheres to Targets Allowed, allowing you to gain resources when attacking enemy units. Does not work on allied/friendly units and buildings.\n      * When attacking units, and even buildings, their researchable upgrades and abilities (some of them) are also taken into account in cost calculation.

Multiple buildings being freed can stack on top of each other in a single location.\n                           * When capturing an Undead building, the blight will stay on where it originally was, and can now be dispelled or cleared..\n                           * If the carrying unit dies and the Undead building is freed somewhere far away from where it once was, the blight is created at its original location, and can still be dispelled or cleared out. Blight is never created on the building’s new location.\n                           * The following will happen when Soul Theft is cast on a building construction in progress:\n                           * Humans: All workers, including the primary one from which the build order came, will simply stop as if the building was canceled. They will need to be manually ordered to continue construction again once the building is freed.\n                           * Undead: The construction progress continues while being captured. When completed, Blight is not created until it is freed, and when freed, the blight will be created in its original location, which can be dispelled or cleared.\n                           * Orc: Construction progress continues while being captured. When completed, the Peon pops back up on the building’s original location, whether the building is freed or not.\n                           * Night Elf: Same as Orcs.\n                           * Buildings going through upgrades (Town Halls) will still continue upgrading while captured.\n                           * Unit training progresses will be paused on capture and resume once freed.\n                           * Though Human Town Halls can’t use Call to Arms on all peasants, individual peasants can still use their own Call to Arms ability. They will walk to the Town Hall’s original location as if it was there.\nIf the Town Hall is freed, they will walk to the new location instead.\n                              * Casting Soul Theft on a Pocket Factory summoned by the ability causes the building to disappear, but still have Clockwerks summoned normally. This is because the Factory building itself doesn’t actually summon units, but only serves as a condition check to stop summoning units once it dies.\n                              * When the carrying unit dies in a location farther than the Leash Range set in the Pocket Factory ability, all previously summoned Clockwerks die, and new ones will spawn in the new location.\n                              * Casting this on your Town Hall causes workers who are gathering resources to act like it's there and return resources on an invisible spot.\n                              * Works on Lumber Drop-off buildings as well (eg: Lumber Mill, Graveyard and War Mill)\n                              * When the carrying unit dies, the Town Hall reappears on that unit’s death location, and workers will immediately update their AI to start walking to that new updated location to return their gathered resources. Works the same for Lumber Drop-off buildings.\n                              * When cast on a Gold Mine, causes Human and Orc workers to simply continue mining from an invisible source. When the carrying unit dies, .\n                              * the AI of Peasants and Orcs will update, and they will now start walking to the new location to harvest gold.\n                              * For Night Elves, casting this on an Entangled Gold Mine causes it to disappear along with the wisps, and prevents you from gaining any gold. When the carrying unit dies, the Entangled Gold Mine appears at the unit’s death location and acts normally again, letting you gain gold.\n                              * For Undead, casting this on a Haunted Gold Mine causes it to disappear, and while the Acolytes will still mine and play their animation, you won’t gain any gold. When the Haunted Gold Mine is freed, the Acolytes will stop playing their animation and the white pentagonal effect on the ground disappears. You will need to select and order them to harvest gold from the new locationCasting this on enemy Heroes causes them to disappear, but their interface icons are still present and you will be revealed to their team, almost as if you cast Devour on that Hero. Same thing happens to non-Hero units.\n                              * Similar to Devour, you are revealed with True Sight even if being a locust with invulnerability.\n                              * Unlike Devour, the revealing sight radius is much larger (720 to all right angles and 656.195 to all diagonal)\n                              * Casting this on yourself (provided that “Self” was included in Targets Allowed), causes you to disappear, but still have your interface icons on if you were a Hero. However, since the captured unit is only freed when the capturing unit dies, you are never freed, also selecting yourself permanently freezes the game.\n                              * Casting this on a Transport Ship or units with Float movement will cause them to be stuck and unable to move on terrain unpathable to them.\n                              * Can be cast to but does nothing when cast on items. (End of notes by RoyGBV)[ao]\n                              * Since the captured unit is simply hidden and added ward ability, effects that summon units when the captured unit dies such as Doom will summon units at the position of the captured unit at the time of casting.\n                              * The captured unit will not get affected by any aura or Pick every unit in Group query.\n                              * Interactions with Reincarnation:\n                              * If the caster dies and begins reviving, the captured unit is released.\n                              * If the captured unit dies with reincarnation available and is still captured and hidden, the buff persists on the caster and the captured unit does not revive.\n                              * If the captured unit dies with reincarnation available and is still captured and not hidden, the buff persists on the caster and the captured unit revives.\n                              * If the target unit has Morph ability on death like when capturing a Phoenix, the Phoenix will not perform that ability and will perish.\n                              * Interactions with more than 2 units:\n                              * Cast multiple times by the same caster on the same unit does nothing. Only that captured unit gets released.\n                              * Cast on multiple units will release all captured units upon the caster dying.\n                              * If the same unit is captured multiple times by different casters, the captured unit simply reappears at each caster’s death location\n                              * If a unit (the first unit) who captures a unit (the second unit), which had previously captured a unit (the third unit) in it then when the first unit dies will release the second unit, the same goes to the second unit when the second unit dies.\n                              * If in this chain capturing the second unit somehow dies, the third unit will reappear at the location of the first unit.\n                              * The death animation of the captured unit only plays when the caster dies.\n                              * If a unit (the first unit) captures a unit (the second unit), then another unit  (the third) captures the second unit, then the first unit captures the third unit. If the first unit dies both the second unit and the third unit reappears but the second unit is paused with ward type. Only after the second unit dies it reappears again next to the third unit and resumes its animation.\n                              * If casting this ability on a unit under Possession (the animation is flying towards it), the unit will not be possessed, the possession casting unit will not die, When the Soul Theft caster dies the captured unit is released with permanent Possession. The same thing happens when the Soul Theft caster dies before the animation reaches.\n                              * If a unit casts Soul Theft on a unit, that unit cannot be cast Devour ability on, to which it display message: Unable to target unit in a buliding or transport.\n                              * If a unit cast Devour on a unit, then a unit casts Soul Theft on devouring unit. The devouring process and killing from devour occurs normally. If the devouring unit dies, it will appear next to the caster who casts Soul Theft.\n                              * If the Devouring unit dies to an ability that summons unit like Doom while under Soul Theft, no unit is summoned regardless of number.\n                              * Casting Soul Theft on a summoned unit does not pause its expiration timer, it will still continue ticking down and will still expire as usual.\n                              * Does not interrupt morphing animations, and the unit will finish morphing and start ticking its morph timer (if it has one) while being captured.\n                              * “Duration - Hero” and “Duration - Normal” don’t do anything. This ability is hard-coded to last indefinitely until the carrying unit dies or until the captured victim dies."
